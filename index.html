        <p> How frequently do you think about your device's battery level ? <br>
            Probably not that often — huh ? . . <br>
            After all, you can almost always find some way to recharge when needed. <br>
            Or perhaps you are always plugged in . . . <br>
            <br>
            Imagine all the chargers in the world suddenly vanished. <br>
            How would you spend the final moments?
