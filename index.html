    <p>I have two ideas right now. First I was thinking of making a responsive site to survey how users utilize their devices
        at particular battery percentages. Will they be more leisurely when their battery is fuller and more productive when their battery is about to die?
        Will they try to conserve as much battery life as possible?... The possibilities are endless.
    </p>
    <p>Another idea is to have a short story about experiences with common mental disorders, this will be presented as either a linear story or clickable objects,
        but each object leads to an unexpected page.
